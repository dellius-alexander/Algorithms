 * BreadthFirstSearch
 *
 * <h2>Procedure BreadthFirstSearchâ€™s Algorithm</h2>
 * <hr/>
 * In a Breadth-First search algorithm we start at some node and traverse
 * a directed graph ending at some destination node. At some point during
 * the course of a traversal, it explores all the neighbors of a node before
 * moving on to the next level of nodes, every node in the graph changes state from
 * undiscovered to discovered. In a breadth-first search of an undirected
 * graph, we assign a direction to each edge, from the discoverer `u` to
 * the discovered `v`. We thus denote `u` to be the parent of child `v`. Since each
 * node has exactly one parent, except for the root, this defines a tree
 * on the vertices of the graph. This algorithm has a modification
 * terminating at your target or destination node.
 * <hr/>
